# Wordle_for_CLUE

This project is a clone of the very popular word solving puzzle game Wordle; made for the Adafruit Clue hardware running Circuit Python 7.x.x. (Clue board: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500)

Custom Keyboard Hardware: https://github.com/MichaelLacock/Open-Blue

Setup:
Once Circuit Python 7.x.x is up an running, just drag and drop the files/folders.  It should look something like this:

)

No keyboard?  No Problem!  You can cycle though the letters with the Clue’s “A” button and confirm the choice with the “B” button.
