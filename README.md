# Wordle_for_CLUE

[-] UPDATED on 2-17-2022, features new and modified word list (it's accurate again).

This project is a clone of the very popular word solving puzzle game Wordle; made for the Adafruit Clue hardware running Circuit Python 7.x.x. (Clue board: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500)

Custom Keyboard Hardware: https://github.com/MichaelLacock/Open-Blue

*** Note that you may need to manually re-add the libraries, there really isn't a good way to re-package the required libraries.

*** KeyBoard Driver library: https://github.com/arturo182/arturo182_CircuitPython_BBQ10Keyboard

*** Circuit Python for CLUE: https://circuitpython.org/board/clue_nrf52840_express/

*** Get 7.x Bundle here: https://circuitpython.org/libraries


Setup:
Once Circuit Python 7.x.x is up an running, just drag and drop the files/folders.  It should look something like this:

![Alt Text]( https://github.com/MichaelLacock/Wordle_for_CLUE/blob/main/examples/keyboard.gif?raw=true
)

No keyboard?  No Problem!  You can cycle though the letters with the Clue’s “A” button and confirm the choice with the “B” button.

Disclaimer:

This recreation of software is under fair-use and is not intended to compete or replace the original software in any way.  This was only intended as a fun project to see if I could recreate something awesome, that is all.

Also, the “lib” folder in this project contains library files that I did not make.  The libraries were made mostly by Adafruit and the keyboard driver by arturo182.
